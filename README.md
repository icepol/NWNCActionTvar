# NWNC - Action Tvar

[https://pixelook.itch.io/action-t](https://pixelook.itch.io/action-t)

The second game for my NWNC friends.

NWNC is the hiking action we organize each year for 13 years already.  
My goal is to make a game for each of the guys joining this event.

How to play:  
Arrow keys to move  
Space to use the knout

Take the steak and hurry up on the fire!
